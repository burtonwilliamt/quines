# Quines
If you aren't familiar, a quine is a program that outputs the exact contents of the program itself.

To quote wikipedia: "A quine is a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source
code as its only output." Interestingly, the output file itself can be run, to create another identical
output file that can be run...ad infinitum.
