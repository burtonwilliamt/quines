#Quines
If you aren't familiar, a quine is a program that outputs the exact contents of the program itself.

If a quine satisfies this condition, it's output can be redirected to an output file that, and that
output file will have no difference from the code file. An exention of this is that the output file
can be run, to create another identical output file, and this new output can be run... This can
go on infinitely.
